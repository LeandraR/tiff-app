# tiff-app

Some notes:
- This is very minimally styled, but has full functionality!  That would be the first thing I would improve (but I'm sadly not a designer :sweat_smile:)
- I moved my API key to a .env so it isn't public.  A key is required to run this locally.

Instructions to run locally are :
1. run `git clone https://github.com/LeandraR/tiff-app.git`
2. `cd tiff-app`
4. `npm i`
5. `npm run start`
